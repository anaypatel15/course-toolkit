# code_snippets

In this folder, we can share useful code snippets and coding ideas for all languages. For each of the files we upload we should follow the pattern showed here:

- The function with clear inputs/outputs
- Comments explaining the logic
- Example use
- Save as: code-snippets/language_function_name.[extension]

This will make it easy to navigate and find the resources you are looking for.
